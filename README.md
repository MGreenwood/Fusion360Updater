# Fusion360Updater
Updates a Fusion360 install automatically

This solution is slightly specific but it will automatically upgrade a Fusion360 install.

#Requirements
Local file in C:\FusionUpdater named currentVersion.ini
  I prefill this to 0.0.0 but you can insert your current installed version
  
#Notes
I use this along with Task Scheduler in Windows to automatically check daily for a new version. I work IT at a school and this has been a nightmare to stay on top of manually.
